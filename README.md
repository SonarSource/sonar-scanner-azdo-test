# Overview

This repository contains a setup for testing the Azure DevOps extensions. It consists of
* A custom Azure DevOps marketplace, where pre-release extensions can be dropped
* A set of pipelines with sample projects that use the pre-release extensions
* A set of projects on SonarQube (peach) and SonarCloud where the analysis results are published

Detailed documentation of the above setups can be found in the [xtranet documentation](https://xtranet-sonarsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SSG/pages/2298478636/Azure+DevOps+extension+for+SonarQube+SonarCloud).
